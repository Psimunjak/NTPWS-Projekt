		<p>Founded twenty years ago, our pizzeria began as a small family-run kitchen with a passion for authentic pizza and warm hospitality. What started as a single oven and a handful of recipes has grown into a beloved local gathering place.</p>
		
		<p>Over the past two decades, we have stayed true to traditional techniques, using hand-stretched dough, slow-rising fermentation, and carefully sourced ingredients. Our commitment to quality and consistency has earned us the trust of generations of customers.</p>
		
		<p>As we celebrate our 20th anniversary, we want to thank our community for being part of our journey. Every pizza we serve carries the same care and dedication that inspired us on day one.</p>
