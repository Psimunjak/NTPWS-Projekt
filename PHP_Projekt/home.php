			This year marks a very special milestone for us: our 20th anniversary. What began as a small neighborhood pizzeria has grown into a beloved local gathering place, thanks to the continued support of our guests, friends, and family.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the past two decades, we’ve stayed true to our original vision—using high-quality ingredients, time-honored recipes, and a whole lot of heart. From our classic wood-fired pizzas to seasonal specials, every dish reflects our commitment to flavor and craftsmanship.

		<p>
			As we celebrate 20 years, we want to thank everyone who has shared a meal, a laugh, and a memory with us. We look forward to many more years of serving great pizza and being part of this amazing community.
